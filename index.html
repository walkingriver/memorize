            You create happiness for our Guests. I want you to write this in your guidebook. I, personally, create
            happiness. This is an incredibly important message for you to remember. Why? Well, here are just a few of
            the reasons.
            When it comes to creating happiness:
             You are the dreamers and doers
             You touch the lives of Guests from around the world every day—by creating happiness
             You can make a little girl feel like a princess or defend a castle from pirate scoundrels—or anything in
            between
             You bring the dream to life by using your imagination, exploring new ideas and innovations, and creating
            an environment of happiness for our Guests, and our fellow Cast Members, Crew Members, and Imagineers
            We have told you that we create happiness, which is based on our traditions and heritage, which guide our
            future. But it all really comes down to you!
            Now, all of this may seem great, but you might be asking yourself, can I really do all this? Will my
            individual role really have that much Guest impact? The answer is yes!
             Do not ever doubt the impact you have on Guests
             Whether you work backstage or on stage, are in professional services or Operations, each of us plays a key
            role in keeping the show alive
            Simply put, it is our people who truly create happiness for our Guests, and we do that in big ways and—more
            often—in our simple, every day actions that often have a greater impact than we expect. Here is an
            experience I had with a Guest that I would like to now share with you.
            <hr />
            There are hundreds of stories like that EVERY day here at Walt Disney World® Resort, at our locations around the world—of Cast Members brightening a Guest’s day with a Mickey Mouse sticker, stopping to take a photo, of just doing our jobs.
            We know you will do great things. I am sure it will not be long before you realize the impact you have made to someone here at Disney.
